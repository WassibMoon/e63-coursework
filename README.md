# E 63 - Big Data Analytics
Professional Graduate Data Science Coursework - Fall semester 2017

## Description: 
The emphasis of this course is on mastering two important big data technologies: Spark 2 and TensorFlow. The focus is on Spark Core, Spark ML (machine learning), and Spark Streaming which allows analysis of data in flight, that is, in near real time.
